How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    very useful

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It will be very easy to track the changes 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

git pros : have the ability to save the correct versions of code
           can work offline
		   collaboration will be easy
git cons : changes can be lost if forgot to commit

google docs: unfinished code is saved and have a risk for migrations

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It will be helpful when we are working on building a new feature & which 
	contains inter related multiple files 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log helps to view file version change while diff helps to find the 
	changes in the file with its previous versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
